## Usage

Simply enter any city name in 'Search for a City' box in the top left of your screen.  Then click 'search' and you will be presented with the both the current and future 5 day forecast weather conditions.  These conditions include temperature, wind speed, humiditiy, the date, and a small icon representation of the weather for that day.  The current weather will be on the top and the 5 day forecast, with corresponding dates, on the bottom.  You will also notice that for each search, a history button will be created on the left hand side of your screen which you can click to revist past searches.  Your search history is saved in local storage to prevent losing history data.  Of course you can clear these manually if you prefer.  This app uses *dayjs* for date functions and *openweathermap api* for gathering weather data.  Enjoy your trip!
